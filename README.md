# Interference-Aware Cooperative Energy Efficiency Maximization Algorithm in 5G UltraDense Networks

Abstract: Ultra-dense networks can further improve the spectrum efficiency (SE) and the energy efficiency (EE). However, the
interference avoidance and the green design are becoming more complex due to the intrinsic densification and scalability. This
research analyze the relationship between the EE and the SE, based on which we formulate the Nash-product EE maximization
problem. Proposed work achieves the closed-form sub-optimal SE equilibrium to maximize the EE performance with and without
the minimum SE constraints. This paper propose a Cooperative Energy Efficiency Maximization Game algorithm, and numerical
results verify the improved EE and fairness of the presented Cooperative Energy Efficiency Maximization Game algorithm
compared with the non-cooperative scheme. In this proposed method, the spectral efficiency and Energy efficiency are improved.
The numerical results are verifying using MATLAB simulations.
